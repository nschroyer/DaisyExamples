# Code Snippet
    void UpdateKnobs()
    {
        int freq = (int) p_freq.Process(); 
        int inversion = (int) p_inversion.Process();
        
        notes[0] = freq + (12 * (inversion >= 1));
        notes[1] = freq + chord[chordNum][0] + (12 * (inversion >= 2));
        notes[2] = freq + chord[chordNum][1] + (12 * (inversion >= 3));
        notes[3] = freq + chord[chordNum][2] + (12 * (inversion >= 4));
    }
